Make a new Rails app!

Do this in a separate repo terminal.

Install a new Rails instance with (1) some clever name, (2) *without* a
copy of the Rails framework within the local directory, and (3)
specifying PostgreSQL. Then (4) start the server and see if it's working.

You should probably double-check that the command is correct before
running it.
