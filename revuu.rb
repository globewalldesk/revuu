    Revuu is a Ruby command line app to help you organize practical reviews of
    programming tasks that you want to learn. You can add problems, solve them
    with your favorite text editor, run the resulting script in Revuu, record
    that you've done a review, and schedule more for the future. The developer
    finds it to be a handy way to learn and solidify easy-to-forget skills.

    No tasks are loaded! Press 'n' to add your first task or press 'a' to load
    a task list from the archive (where you can find some sample data to play
    with). Choose your text editor with 'e' and your default programming
    language with 'p'. For a general introduction and detailed instructions,
    press '?'.
